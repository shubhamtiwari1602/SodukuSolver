# üß© Sudoku Solver in C++

This is a simple yet powerful C++ implementation of a Sudoku Solver using **backtracking**. It solves a standard 9√ó9 Sudoku puzzle with some pre-filled numbers and blank cells.

---

## üìå What This Project Does

- Accepts a Sudoku board with `-1` as blank cells.
- Uses **recursive backtracking** to try all possible values.
- Checks each placement for validity according to Sudoku rules.
- Prints the solved Sudoku grid or tells if no solution exists.

---

## üß† How It Works ‚Äì In Plain English

1. **What is Sudoku?**  
   A 9√ó9 grid divided into 3√ó3 subgrids. Fill it such that:
   - Every row has numbers from 1 to 9 with no repetition.
   - Every column has numbers from 1 to 9 with no repetition.
   - Every 3√ó3 subgrid has numbers from 1 to 9 with no repetition.

2. **How Do We Solve It?**  
   We look at every empty cell (i.e., `-1`) and try placing numbers 1 to 9. For each number:
   - If it doesn't break any rules (row, column, or box), we place it and move to the next cell.
   - If it leads to a dead end, we **undo** the move and try the next number.
   - This is called **backtracking** ‚Äì trying possibilities and going back when stuck.

3. **How We Find 3√ó3 Grid?**  
   Each cell belongs to a 3√ó3 block. For cell `(row, col)`:
   ```cpp
   int startRow = row - row % 3;
   int startCol = col - col % 3;
````

This gives the **top-left corner** of the subgrid the cell is in.

## üîç Code Overview

### `isValid(board, row, col, num)`

Checks if placing `num` in `(row, col)` follows Sudoku rules:

* No duplicate in same row.
* No duplicate in same column.
* No duplicate in the 3√ó3 subgrid.

### `solveSudoku(board)`

Recursive backtracking function:

* Finds the next empty cell.
* Tries numbers 1 to 9.
* If placing a number works, recursively solve next cells.
* If not, reset the cell to `-1` (backtrack).

### `printBoard(board)`

Prints the board, showing `-1` as `.` for readability.

## üß™ Dry Run Example

Suppose we have the following board:

```
5 3 . . 7 . . . .
6 . . 1 9 5 . . .
. 9 8 . . . . 6 .
8 . . . 6 . . . 3
4 . . 8 . 3 . . 1
7 . . . 2 . . . 6
. 6 . . . . 2 8 .
. . . 4 1 9 . . 5
. . . . 8 . . 7 9
```

Here's how the algorithm starts:

1. Find first `-1` ‚Üí cell `(0,2)`.
2. Try numbers 1 to 9:

   * 1 is valid ‚Üí place 1.
   * Call recursively for next empty cell.
3. This continues until a full valid board is found or we backtrack and try a different number.

## üõ† How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++):

```bash
g++ -o sudoku_solver sudoku_solver.cpp
./sudoku_solver
```

5 3 4 6 7 8 9 1 2 
6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8 
1 9 8 3 4 2 5 6 7 
8 5 9 7 6 1 4 2 3 
4 2 6 8 5 3 7 9 1 
7 1 3 9 2 4 8 5 6 
9 6 1 5 3 7 2 8 4 
2 8 7 4 1 9 6 3 5 
3 4 5 2 8 6 1 7 9 
```

## üìö Topics Covered

* Recursion
* Backtracking
* 2D Vectors
* Condition Checking
* Dry Run / Debugging Logic

## üöÄ Enhancements You Can Try

* Add user input for the Sudoku board.
* Use `0` instead of `-1` for blanks.
* Build a GUI using SFML or Qt.
